# Research Interests
On the theoretical side, I am pursuing the question: how much data is necessary to obtain a decent (Gaussian process) model.
Importantly, I want an answer for a dataset at hand and NOT for all datasets. Optimal stopping and probably-approximately-correct bounds are tools, I am interested to answer that question.

On the practical side, I want to improve the protein-design workflow. With Bayesian optimization, I hope to reduce the number of expensive and time consuming wetlab experiments. Using results from preceding experiments, unlabelled data from related tasks and simulations, should allow to make informed choices about which protein modifications are worthwhile to explore.
